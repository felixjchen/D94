- influential, inspired many modern libarires

Context:
	- Google needs to reverse index the web
	- Multi hour computations of terabytes of data => Fragile => Fault Tolerence
	Goal: make it easy for non experts to write distributed applications
	Approach: 
		- Computations are framed only in maps and reduces
		- MapReduce abstracts away distributed system problems, faults, latency, crash .. 
	IDEA: Why not a more powerfull FP function, such as fold ? map and reduce will fall out of this and we might even get the begining of a distributed FP library . Because foldl is very sequential and hard to parallelize 
	
Abstract View:
	files: f1, f2, f3
	e.g. map counts occurence of words
	f1 -> a,1   b,1
	f2 ->        b,1
	f3 -> a,1          c,1
	"shuffle" reduce collects results accross machines
	=> 	   a,2  b,2  c,1
	- Expensive: shuffling data, "aggregate" values from all map outputs
    Note: Reduce can run indepdenently
	e.g. sorting
	mappers sort a bukect
	reducer combines buckets for total sort
	
	
Note: Intermediate results are stored on disk of worker 
When all maps are done, master will start running reduces, retrieivng data from intermediate results (remote reads are transfered to reducer), and reduces the data. 

Idea: Intermediate results are SORTED. such that reducers can handler certain keys
	

Fault Tolerence:
	- Master can re run map/reduce jobs, if a worker doesnt respond within a threshold. When workers become free again and there are more jobs, they ask master for new tasks.
	- Tasks can be run multiple times, but FP/deterministic principles are nice here
	
Other Failures:
	Master fails ? Entire job needs rerun, no plan for master failures. Master has state, it keeps track of workers completing tasks. 
	Slow workers ? Stragglers, task is run again on a seperate machine
	Idea: To solve tail latency, we can replicate tasks, so slow machines are slowing us down
