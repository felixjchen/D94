Why Go ?
	- Strong RPC and thread support
	- garbage collection convient for threads 
	- type safety
	- compiled
	
Thread of Execution
	- in Go, go routine
	- has its on program counter, stack, registers... 
	- same process => threads can share memory
	
Why Threads ?
	- express concurrency
		- I/O concurrency, e.g. network or files
		- Multi core parrallelism, i.e. core1 core2 doing parrallel tasks
		- convientent 
		
Thread Challenges
	- race conditions, shared memory, "Critical Section"
		=> Avoid sharing => go chans
									=> use locks, make sequences of instructions atomic
	- race detector , go has a race flag that can detect race conditions
	- coordination, channels + condition variables
	- deadlock, go may detect this
	
Go Addresses These Challenges:
	Channels
		(no shared memory)
		channels block until read is done
	Locks + Condition Variables
		(shared memory)
		cond.Broadcast(), cond.Wait(), wait blocks until a broadcast is done

Note: Main threads exit => Child threads exit
Q: Why are we locking for reading ? 

Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
Goal: RPC ~= PC
- clients and servers
Client
	z = fn(x,y)
Server
	fn(x,y int ){ return x+y}
- Client gets server to run actual computation
- when client calls fn(x,y), a stub is created
	- a stub containers what function needs to be called, and args
	- server gets stub
	- server unmarshells stub
	- server calls function with args, computes 
	- server marshells output into stub
	- client waiting for stub response
	- client unmarshells stub response
	- client has response

GO RPC:
	client.Call("KV.Get", &args, &reply)
	- Call takes : server side func, args, and reply variable
	- reply is filled
	Server needs to implement KV.Get, capital method name for public method, and rpcs := rpc.NewServer()
	rpcs.Register(kv)
	will recognize public methods
	Note: Need to lock put/gets, these are critical sections!
	
RPC semantics under failures:
 	- what does client do under server crash
	at-least-once: client will retry until server executes at least once... put may be executed more then once 
	at-most-once: client wont retry, server executes 0 or once. 
	exactly-once: hard to arrange
	- these failures seperate RPC from procedure calls
