Leader Election Rule
	- majority vote must be achieved
	- at least up to date

Log Divergence
	- many different ways to diverge
	- servers have their own term number
	
Log Catchup
	- leader keeps next_index, optimisitc, same value as itself's next log index "guess"
	- leader tries to append entries, follower will reject if previous term + previous index is incorrect
	- on follower reject, it decrements next index and tries again (unoptimized)
	- leader also tracks matchIndex, pesimistic, 0 for all INIT.
	- ACKs can update matchIndex

Erasing Log Entries
	- commit after the leader has commited one entry in its own term

Log Catchup (quickly)
	- idea: backup of by terms instead of indexs
	- Rejection includes:
		- conflicting term (i)
		- conflitcing index (earliest index with ith term)
	- this way we can skip a bunch of indexs..
	

Persistence: What happens on reboot
- options:
	1. fresh join=> recieve entire log array
		- lots of log :( 
	2. start from state on disk => catch up 
		- what kind of state needs to persist? whats essential for this option?
		- currentFor: vote in this term (need this for vote atomicity)
		- currentTerm: term number (need this for state)
		- log[] : log arr (need this for majorities. promised leader to commit this)

Service Recovery
1. Replay Log => Recreate state from scratch, expensive
2.  Snapshotting
	- state contains all operations [0, i]
	- state can reconstruct an equivalent log
	- cut all logs through i, but snapshot contains state
	- snapshot must be on disk
	- snapshots must be sent to new followers

Using Raft
- each worker contains the service and the raft library
- these two commmunicate through the applyChannel
- clients understand some part of replicated state machines.. who the leader is and switching to a follower
- we need duplicate detection, requests have unique IDs
- clients have clerk library, that abstracts unique IDs and RAFT lib

Correctness
- roughly behaves like a single machine
- "linearizability" is strong consistency
	1. There exists some total  order of operations
	2. matches real-time, based on request time
	3. read returns result of last write
- "stale values" are not allowed
